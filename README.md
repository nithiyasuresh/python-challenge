# python-challenge
Python Assignment
Created folder structure and added/created the required files for the python assignment.
PyBank Analysis:
Create psuedo code to begin with the help of tutor.
Made step by step progress as per the readme file in the gitlab repo, printing each output as and when creating the code, to check that the output received is in alignment with the expected output.
Completed pybank challenge first - which was harder to write.
Once pybank completed, pypoll was relatively easier to finish.
